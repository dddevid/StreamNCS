# StreamNCS
This project allows you to play only the audio from the **nocopyrightsounds** Twitch channel or YouTube stream on a webpage. The video player is hidden, but the audio still plays, making it ideal for those who want to listen to music or audio streams without showing the video.

## Features
- Plays audio from the **nocopyrightsounds** YouTube channel automatically.
- The video player is hidden, so the page doesn't load or display the video.
- Ideal for OBS users who want to add just the audio stream.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Save the `index.html` file in your project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to listen to the audio.
4. To add the audio to OBS, drag the button below into your OBS window to automatically create a new audio source.


## Add Audio to OBS

Drag the button below directly into OBS to create an audio source that plays **nocopyrightsounds** audio 24/7.
